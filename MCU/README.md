# MaxStats Arduino Hardware Code
Uses [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/) for VS Code to compile and upload. Currently only the [Pro Micro board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) (or equivalents from AliExpress) is fully supported. Edit the `include/config.h` file for changing settings if you're compiling on your own.
