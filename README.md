Showing you your powerhouse of a computer at all times. Brought to you by a college student, his Twitch chat, and autogenerated music playlists.

## Building
If you'd like to build the bleeding edge commits, you'll need to clone/download the repo.

- `Desktop` is for the MaxStats desktop client, and can be built using your choice of C# IDE such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider. It runs the .NET Framework v4.8.
- `MCU` is for the microcontroller board you're using, and is built with any [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) compatible IDE, or the PlatformIO CLI app.

## Hardware and Wiring
Currently the project *in code* only officially supports the [Pro Micro board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) (or equivalent from AliExpress) and, experimentally, the Teensy (LC, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.6, requires edit to config.h). Currently only ST7735 and ST7789 screens are supported. Certain pins can be configured in `MCU/include/config.h`. See the pinout below for the default wiring of the Pro Micro board.

| Screen Pins (ST7735 & 89) | ProMicro Pins |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| VCC (Power)               | VCC           |
| GND (Ground)              | GND           |
| DIN (Data In)             | 16 (MOSI)     |
| CLK (Clock)               | 15 (SCLK)     |
| CS (Chip Select)          | 10            |
| DC (Data Command)         | 9             |
| RST (Reset)               | 8             |
| BL (Backlight)            | 7             |

## 3D Printing
The 3D printable parts are in `Printables`. The parts were designed to fit a ProMicro board (USB facing downward) and wires. I recommend printing the screen plate face down, and the body on its solid side with supports for the USB housing. The screen is held in with some friction from the body, no screws. If you feel it necessary, put some glue on the sides of the body where the screen parts meet.
